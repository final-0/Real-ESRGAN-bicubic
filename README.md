## Absutract <br>
You can use this [Real-SRGAN-bicubic] to train and test yourself.
In this repository, for simplicity, we will only perform super-resolution on images that have been compressed using the bicubic method.
There are two types of test codes, "esrgan_bicubic.py" and "esrgan_cross.py", and it is generally better to use "esrgan_bicubic.py".
The "esrgan_cross.py" uses a special loss function.
