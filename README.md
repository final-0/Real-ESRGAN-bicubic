# Real-ESRGAN-bicubic

##Absutract <br>
In SRGAN, you can train and test yourself. 
In this repository, for simplicity, we will only perform super-resolution on images that have been compressed using the bicubic method.
There are two types of test codes, "esrgan_bicubic" and "esrgan_cross", and it is generally better to use "esrgan_bicubic".
The "esrgan_cross" uses a special loss function.
